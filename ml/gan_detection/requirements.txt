# GAN Fraud Detection Module Dependencies
# VE-923: GAN-based synthetic image detection

# Core dependencies (versions from requirements-deterministic.txt)
numpy>=1.26.0
Pillow>=10.0.0

# Testing dependencies
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0

# Note: This module intentionally avoids heavy deep learning frameworks
# for the discriminator implementation to maintain determinism and
# reduce deployment complexity. The CNN is implemented using NumPy
# for full control over numerical operations.
#
# For production deployment with GPU acceleration, consider:
# tensorflow-cpu==2.15.0
# onnxruntime==1.16.3
