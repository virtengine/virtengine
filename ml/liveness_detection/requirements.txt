# Liveness Detection Module Requirements
# VE-901: Anti-spoofing liveness detection

# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.20.0

# Optional: OpenCV for advanced image processing
# opencv-python>=4.5.0

# Note: This module is designed to have minimal dependencies
# to ensure deterministic execution across validators.
# Heavy dependencies like TensorFlow/PyTorch are NOT used
# to maintain reproducibility and reduce attack surface.
