<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.gsd/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .gsd/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
../skills/map-codebase/SKILL.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Focus area: $ARGUMENTS (optional - if provided, tells agents to focus on specific subsystem)

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .gsd/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**

- Before /new-project.md (brownfield codebases) - creates codebase map first
- After /new-project.md (greenfield codebases) - updates codebase map as code evolves
- Anytime to refresh codebase understanding
  </context>

<when_to_use>
**Use map-codebase for:**

- Brownfield projects before initialization (understand existing code first)
- Refreshing codebase map after significant changes
- Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase
- Before major refactoring (understand current state)
- When STATE.md references outdated codebase info

**Skip map-codebase for:**

- Greenfield projects with no code yet (nothing to map)
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
  </when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .gsd/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .gsd/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Offer next steps (typically: /new-project.md or /plan-phase.md)
</process>

<success_criteria>

- [ ] .gsd/codebase/ directory created
- [ ] All 7 codebase documents written by mapper agents
- [ ] Documents follow template structure
- [ ] Parallel agents completed without errors
- [ ] User knows next steps
      </success_criteria>
