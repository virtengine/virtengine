Use `scripts/codex-monitor/ve-kanban.ps1` to manage the backlog directly via the HTTP API. Do **NOT** use MCP vibe-kanban tools. Tasks should be detailed and thorough - all tasks should be tasks that involve lots of changes (minimum of 2-10k lines of code changes). Tasks should be prioritized into task execution order & parallel execution where possible. For e.g. 1A-1D would be 4 tasks that are triggered in parallel and before tasks 2A-2X which would be sequential tasks to be triggered after 1A-1D are complete.

When creating tasks, use the direct CLI wrapper:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/codex-monitor/ve-kanban.ps1 create --title "<title>" --description "<markdown>" --status todo
```

## CRITICAL: Task Quality Guardrails

### Minimum Task Complexity Requirements

Every task MUST meet ALL of these criteria. If a proposed task fails any criterion, it must be expanded, merged into a larger task, or discarded.

1. **Multi-file, multi-package scope**: Must touch at least **5+ files** across **2+ Go packages** (or equivalent for portal/SDK/ML). Single-file changes are never standalone tasks.
2. **Implementation + Tests + Integration**: Every task must include production code implementation, unit tests, AND integration/wiring work. Never create a task that is ONLY tests, ONLY docs, or ONLY CI config.
3. **2-3 hours minimum for a senior engineer**: If a competent senior Go/blockchain engineer could finish it in under 2 hours, the task is too small. Merge it into a related larger task.
4. **Grounded in source code reading**: Every scope item must reference specific files, functions, or line numbers that the planner has actually read. Never create tasks based on file names alone — read the code to understand what's missing.
5. **Minimum estimated line changes**: Each task should involve **2,000-10,000 lines** of code changes (implementation + tests combined).

### PROHIBITED Task Patterns (Never Create These)

These patterns have historically produced trivial tasks that waste agent execution time. NEVER create standalone tasks matching these patterns:

| Anti-Pattern                            | Why It's Wrong                                         | What To Do Instead                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test(X): implement tests for module X` | Test-only tasks are trivial                            | Include tests as part of the implementation task for module X                |
| `test(X): add test coverage for Y`      | Coverage expansion without implementation is low-value | Bundle into the feature task that creates the code being tested              |
| `docs: extract/update/maintain X`       | Doc-only tasks are trivial for agents                  | Include documentation updates as acceptance criteria in implementation tasks |
| `ci: fix/sweep/resolve workflows`       | Vague CI tasks with no specific scope                  | Specify exact CI files, exact errors, and exact fixes needed                 |
| `chore: bump dependency X`              | Dependency bumps are trivial                           | Only create if the bump requires significant code migration (API changes)    |
| `fix(X): resolve lint warnings`         | Lint fixes are trivial                                 | Include as part of a larger refactor or security task                        |
| `style(X): format/cleanup module Y`     | Formatting is trivial                                  | Never create this as a standalone task                                       |
| `refactor(X): rename/move Y`            | Simple renames are trivial                             | Only if the refactor involves architectural restructuring                    |

### Required Task Description Structure

Every task description MUST include ALL of these sections with substantive content:

```markdown
Priority: P0|P1|P2
Tags: <comma-separated module labels>

## Goal

<1-3 sentences explaining the business/technical value and what gap this fills>

## Scope

### 1. <Section Name> (~line estimate)

- <Specific implementation detail referencing actual files/functions>
- <What to create/modify/delete with rationale>

### 2. <Section Name> (~line estimate)

- <More specific details>

### 3. Tests (~line estimate)

- <Unit test scope>
- <Integration test scope>
- <Edge cases to cover>

## Acceptance Criteria

- <Measurable, verifiable outcomes — not vague "works correctly">
- <Specific queries/commands that must succeed>
- <Build/test commands that must pass>

## Testing

\`\`\`bash
<exact test commands to run>
\`\`\`

## Estimated Effort

<X-Y hours senior engineer / X-Y hours agent>

## Dependencies

Depends on: <task IDs>
Blocks: <task IDs>
```

### Pre-Creation Checklist

Before creating any task, verify:

- [ ] I have READ the actual source code files relevant to this task (not just file names)
- [ ] The task touches 5+ files across 2+ packages
- [ ] The task includes both implementation AND tests
- [ ] A senior engineer would need 2-3+ hours to complete this
- [ ] The task does NOT match any prohibited anti-pattern above
- [ ] I have checked existing backlog AND done tasks for duplicates/overlap
- [ ] I have checked `_docs/KANBAN_SPLIT_TRACKER.md` for secondary kanban duplicates
- [ ] The description includes Goal, Scope (with line estimates), Acceptance Criteria, Testing commands, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies
- [ ] Each scope section references specific files, functions, or line numbers I actually read

### Overlap Prevention

Before creating a task, search existing backlog (todo + done + cancelled) for:

1. **Title keyword overlap**: Search for the same module name + feature keywords
2. **Scope overlap**: Read descriptions of related tasks and check if >30% of scope overlaps
3. **Subsumption check**: If the new task is a strict subset of an existing task, do NOT create it
4. **If overlap exists**: Either expand the existing task, or ensure the new task explicitly references the existing one in Dependencies and explains what is additive

## Task Planner Orchestration Requirements

- Assign analysis domains per agent (e.g., chain/x modules, app/cmd wiring, provider daemon, portal/SDK integrations, testing/ops/docs). Use agent/runSubagent to gather domain-specific gaps + candidate tasks.
- **Subagents MUST read actual source code** — not just list file names. Each subagent must:
  - Read at least 3-5 key files per module domain (keeper.go, msg_server.go, module.go, types/params.go, etc.)
  - Identify specific stub/placeholder/TODO patterns in the code
  - Report exact file paths and line numbers for gaps found
  - Distinguish between "file exists" and "file has real implementation"
- Aggregate outputs into one plan: normalize titles, merge overlaps, and dedupe against existing kanban tasks plus any tasks created in the last 24h (use vibe-kanban/list_tasks and created_at timestamps). Also check \_docs/KANBAN_SPLIT_TRACKER.md to avoid secondary-kanban duplicates.
- Sequence dependencies explicitly (e.g., 32A-32D parallel, 33A+ sequential). Include "Depends on:" lines in each task description when needed.
- Create tasks with priority tags: include "Priority: P0|P1|P2" and "Tags: <labels>" in the description, and prefix title with "[P0]" for critical items.
- **Title prefix must include size tag**: `[xl]` for all tasks (since all tasks must be substantial). Include priority: `[xl] [P0]` or `[xl] [P1]`.

### Naming Convention

```
[xl] [P0|P1|P2] type(scope): descriptive name SEQUENCE
```

✅ Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

📌 Examples:

```
[xl] [P0] feat(provider): wire market chain client stubs to x/market gRPC — bid engine activation 66A
[xl] [P0] feat(staking): implement MsgServer + wire BeginBlocker/EndBlocker 66B
[xl] [P1] feat(settlement): CLI commands + HPC↔settlement unification + escrow reconciliation 67B
```

❌ BAD Examples (would be rejected):

```
test(settlement): integration tests 56B          ← test-only, no implementation
docs(ralph): extract patent text 57A              ← doc-only, trivial
ci sweep: resolve failing workflows               ← vague, no specific scope
feat(encryption): key rotation 60A                ← duplicate of completed 39B
```

## Progress Tracking

You should also track the current progress of the project into \_docs/ralph/progress.md

You should use \_docs\ralph_patent_text.txt as a source of truth for what the original project intends to deliver, it should be used a basis of comparison of the functionality delivered in the source code and the gaps remaining between the source code and the intended specification.

Your analysis should be thorough, you should go through the changes that have been made since the last progreess.md analysis and identify if acceptance criteria has been met for tasks completed between the last analysis and the current date, along with uncovering new gaps that have not been identified in the previous analysis and should be completed.

Tasks added to the backlog should be documented into the progress.md with the status of the task (e.g. planned, completed) so that it can be tracked into the functionality of the project.

Your goal is NOT to implement any code, only create a thorough plan for tasks that need to be completed - and these tasks should be properly added to the backlog of vibe-kanban through MCP Tool calling, you should not duplicate any previously used sequences (for e.g. if currently the latest backlog tasks are 7A-7D then you should add tasks from 8A onwards unless the new task needs to be completed before the other backlog tasks due to priorities or dependancies)

You should always assume progress.md is OUTDATED and a new analysis should be done of the project to determine what progress if any has happened since the last analysis.

## Self-Validation Before Finishing

Before completing a planning session, review your created tasks against the guardrails above. If any task:

- Has fewer than 3 scope sections → expand it
- Doesn't reference specific files/lines → read more code
- Could be done in <2 hours by a senior engineer → merge into a larger task
- Matches a prohibited anti-pattern → delete and restructure
- Overlaps >30% with an existing task → consolidate or add dependency notes
