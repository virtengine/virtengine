      "title": "feat(encryption): data vault access control + audit logging 33A",
      "description": "Goal: deliver the missing Phase 2–6 capabilities of the Data Vault so sensitive data access is role/organization gated and fully auditable, aligning with the AU2024203136A1-LIVE requirements for encrypted data + audit logs.\n\nScope (est. 5k–8k LOC):\n- Access control enforcement for vault decrypt/read operations (wallet auth + org/role gating).\n- Immutable audit log for every decrypt/read (who/what/why/when), stored in ScopeAudit and exposed via API.\n- gRPC/HTTP endpoints for Vault CRUD + audit search (provider daemon + portal API gateway).\n- Integration points for VEID documents, support tickets, marketplace artifacts to use vault APIs.\n- Migration helpers for existing plaintext artifacts (if any).\n- Metrics + alerts for vault access anomalies.\n- Docs + runbook updates.\n\nImplementation outline:\n1) Define AccessControl interface + policies in `pkg/data_vault` and implement role/org checks against `x/roles` and org membership (x/group). \n2) Implement AuditLogger with append-only storage + hash chaining; add export hooks.\n3) Add provider daemon endpoints for vault CRUD/audit; enforce request signing.\n4) Wire vault usage into VEID/support/market workflows (read-only audit). \n5) Add unit + integration tests for access control and audit logging.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Unauthorized wallet/org access is blocked and returns explicit errors.\n- Every decrypt/read produces an immutable audit record (hash chained).\n- Vault APIs exposed with auth + rate limits; basic client examples in docs.\n- Tests cover access matrix, audit logs, and API error paths.\n\nDependencies:\n- Leverage 30B (HSM integration) and 32A (vault core) already completed.\n\nTesting:\n- `go test ./pkg/data_vault/...` + new API tests.\n- Provider daemon API contract tests.",
