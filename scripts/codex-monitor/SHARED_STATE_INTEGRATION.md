# Shared State Manager Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the shared state manager with existing codex-monitor claim and sync flows. The integration provides distributed task coordination across multiple agents and workstations with heartbeat-based liveness detection and conflict resolution.

## Modified Files

### 1. `scripts/codex-monitor/task-claims.mjs`

**Changes:**

- Added imports for `claimTaskInSharedState`, `renewSharedStateHeartbeat`, and `releaseSharedState`
- Added environment variable configuration constants:
  - `SHARED_STATE_ENABLED` (default: true)
  - `SHARED_STATE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` (default: 60000)
  - `SHARED_STATE_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` (default: 300000)
  - `SHARED_STATE_MAX_RETRIES` (default: 3)

**Integration Points:**

- **`claimTask()`**: After successful local claim, calls `claimTaskInSharedState()` to sync to shared state
  - Non-blocking: logs warnings on failure, continues with local claim
  - Logs at INFO level on success
- **`renewClaim()`**: Calls `renewSharedStateHeartbeat()` after renewing local claim
  - Graceful degradation on failure
- **`releaseTask()`**: Calls `releaseSharedState()` with final status
  - Marks as "complete" for normal release
  - Marks as "abandoned" for forced release

**Error Handling:**

- All shared state operations wrapped in try-catch
- Failures logged as warnings, don't block local claim operations
- Ensures backward compatibility if shared state is unavailable

### 2. `scripts/codex-monitor/sync-engine.mjs`

**Changes:**

- Added import for `getSharedState`
- Added local implementation of `isHeartbeatStale()` (not exported from shared-state-manager)
- Added environment variable configuration

**Integration Points:**

- **`pullFromExternal()`**:
  - Reads shared state metadata from external adapter (e.g., GitHub comments)
  - Merges shared state data into internal task metadata:
    - `sharedStateOwnerId`
    - `sharedStateHeartbeat`
    - `sharedStateRetryCount`
  - Graceful handling of shared state read failures

- **`pushToExternal()`**:
  - Checks shared state before pushing to detect conflicts
  - If another owner has a fresher heartbeat, skips push and logs conflict
  - Increments `conflicts` counter in sync result
  - Graceful degradation: continues with push if shared state check fails

- **`syncSharedState()`**:
  - New method for explicit shared state synchronization
  - Placeholder for future kanban adapter support

- **`getStatus()`**:
  - Added `sharedStateEnabled` to status output

**Conflict Resolution:**

- Before pushing dirty tasks, checks if another owner has an active claim
- Respects heartbeat freshness (using `SHARED_STATE_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS`)
- Only skips push if conflict owner's heartbeat is fresh (not stale)

### 3. `scripts/codex-monitor/ve-orchestrator.mjs`

**Changes:**

- Added imports for `shouldRetryTask`, `sweepStaleSharedStates`, and `releaseSharedState`
- Added environment variable configuration

**Integration Points:**

- **`fillCapacity()`** (before claiming task):
  - Calls `shouldRetryTask()` to check if task should be retried
  - Skips tasks with:
    - `ignoreReason` flag set
    - Retry count exceeding `SHARED_STATE_MAX_RETRIES`
    - Active claims by other agents
  - Graceful degradation: continues with task on check failure

- **`reconcileMergedAttempts()`** (on task completion):
  - Calls `releaseSharedState()` to mark task as "complete"
  - Uses attempt's `claim_token` for verification
  - Logs success/failure at INFO/WARN level

- **Main orchestrator loop** (every cycle):
  - Calls `sweepStaleSharedStates()` to mark abandoned tasks
  - Uses `SHARED_STATE_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` for staleness detection
  - Logs swept task count and IDs
  - Graceful handling of sweep failures

**Periodic Operations:**

- Stale state sweep runs on every orchestrator cycle (default: 90 seconds)
- Automatically reclaims tasks with stale heartbeats

### 4. `scripts/codex-monitor/.env.example`

**New Environment Variables:**

```bash
# ─── Task Claims and Coordination ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Shared state manager enables distributed task coordination across multiple
# agents and workstations. Provides atomic operations, heartbeat-based liveness
# detection, and conflict resolution.

# Enable/disable shared state coordination (default: true)
SHARED_STATE_ENABLED=true

# Heartbeat renewal interval in milliseconds (default: 60000 = 1 minute)
SHARED_STATE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS=60000

# Heartbeat staleness threshold in milliseconds (default: 300000 = 5 minutes)
# Tasks with stale heartbeats are considered abandoned and can be reclaimed
SHARED_STATE_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS=300000

# Maximum retry attempts before permanently ignoring a task (default: 3)
SHARED_STATE_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Task claim owner staleness threshold in milliseconds (default: 600000 = 10 minutes)
# Used by task-claims.mjs to detect stale local claims
TASK_CLAIM_OWNER_STALE_TTL_MS=600000
```

## Behavior & Features

### Backward Compatibility

- **All shared state operations are non-blocking**
- If shared state fails, local claims still work
- Can be disabled completely via `SHARED_STATE_ENABLED=false`
- Graceful degradation: logs warnings but continues operation

### Logging

- **INFO level**: Successful shared state operations
  - "Shared state synced for {taskId}"
  - "Shared state released for {taskId}"
  - "swept N stale shared state(s)"
- **WARN level**: Shared state failures (non-critical)
  - "Shared state sync failed for {taskId}: {error}"
  - "Shared state check failed for {taskId}: {error}"

### Conflict Resolution

- **First-come-first-served**: Existing active claims take precedence
- **Heartbeat-based**: Stale claims (>5 minutes by default) can be taken over
- **Coordinator priority**: Coordinators can override non-coordinator claims
- **Sync conflicts**: Push operations skip tasks with fresher external claims

### Retry Logic

- Tasks can be retried up to `SHARED_STATE_MAX_RETRIES` times (default: 3)
- Failed attempts increment retry counter in shared state
- Orchestrator checks retry eligibility before claiming tasks
- Tasks exceeding max retries are automatically skipped

### Heartbeat Mechanism

- Local claims renew heartbeat every `SHARED_STATE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` (default: 60s)
- Tasks with heartbeat older than `SHARED_STATE_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` (default: 300s) are considered abandoned
- Orchestrator sweeps stale states every cycle (default: 90s)

## Testing

Created `test-shared-state-integration.mjs` to verify:

1. All module imports work correctly
2. Shared state functions are accessible
3. Environment variables have correct defaults
4. Basic operations (claim, retrieve, release) work
5. Integration with task-claims, sync-engine, and ve-orchestrator

## Architecture Notes

### Data Flow

1. **Local Claim** → **Shared State Claim** (task-claims.mjs)
2. **External Kanban** ← **Sync Engine** ← **Shared State** (sync-engine.mjs)
3. **Orchestrator** → **Check Shared State** → **Claim Task** (ve-orchestrator.mjs)

### State Hierarchy

- **Local Claims** (.cache/codex-monitor/task-claims.json): Process-level claims
- **Shared State** (.cache/codex-monitor/shared-task-states.json): Cross-instance coordination
- **External Kanban** (GitHub/VK): User-facing task board

### Conflict Priority

1. External kanban status changes (human overrides)
2. Shared state active claims (cross-instance coordination)
3. Local claims (process-level locks)

## Future Enhancements

1. **External adapter integration**: Store shared state in GitHub issue comments
2. **Heartbeat auto-renewal**: Background thread to renew heartbeats automatically
3. **Metrics collection**: Track claim conflicts, retries, and sweep operations
4. **Admin UI**: Dashboard to view and manage shared state across instances

## Deployment Notes

- **No breaking changes**: Existing installations continue to work
- **Opt-out available**: Set `SHARED_STATE_ENABLED=false` to disable
- **No migration required**: Shared state registry is created on first use
- **Backward compatible**: Works with or without external adapter support
