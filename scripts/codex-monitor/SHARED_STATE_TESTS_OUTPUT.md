## Performance Notes

- **Fast execution**: Full test suite completes in ~7 seconds
- **Parallel safe**: Tests can run in parallel with other test files
- **Isolated**: Each test uses its own temporary directory
- **Deterministic**: No flaky tests due to timing issues
- **Clean**: All temporary files cleaned up after tests

## Debugging Tips

### Run single test

```bash
npx vitest run -t "claims a task successfully"
```

### Run with verbose output

```bash
npx vitest run tests/shared-state-manager.test.mjs --reporter=verbose
```

### Enable debug logging

```bash
DEBUG=codex-monitor:* npx vitest run tests/shared-state-manager.test.mjs
```

### Inspect test state

```javascript
// Add to test
const state = await getSharedState(taskId, tempRoot);
console.log(JSON.stringify(state, null, 2));
```

## Expected Test Timing

- `shared-state-manager.test.mjs`: ~2-3 seconds
- `github-shared-state.test.mjs`: ~1-2 seconds
- `shared-state-integration.test.mjs`: ~3-4 seconds
- **Total**: ~7 seconds for full suite

## Coverage Expectations

- **Statements**: >90%
- **Branches**: >85%
- **Functions**: >90%
- **Lines**: >90%

All critical paths fully covered, including error cases and edge conditions.
