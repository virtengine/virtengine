// Deprecated: The external sync types have been simplified. External ticket
// references are now handled by the ExternalTicketRef type in ticket.go.
// Waldur handles the full ticket lifecycle including Jira integration.
//
// This file is kept for backward compatibility during migration. New code
// should use ExternalTicketRef from ticket.go.
