=== BUILD RESULTS ===
COMMAND: go build ./x/bme/... ./x/oracle/...
STATUS: UNABLE TO EXECUTE
REASON: PowerShell sessions terminate prematurely - environment issue prevents command execution.
All attempts (sync, async, Start-Process, Python subprocess) resulted in invalid shell sessions.
BUILD EXIT CODE: N/A (could not run)

=== TEST RESULTS ===
COMMAND: go test ./x/bme/keeper/... ./x/oracle/keeper/...
STATUS: UNABLE TO EXECUTE
REASON: Same environment issue - PowerShell sessions become invalid immediately after timeout.
TEST EXIT CODE: N/A (could not run)

=== MODULE VERIFICATION ===
The following modules and test files exist and appear properly structured:

x/bme/
  - module.go
  - keeper/keeper.go, keeper_test.go, msg_server.go, msg_server_test.go, genesis.go, genesis_test.go
  - types/

x/oracle/
  - module.go
  - keeper/keeper.go, keeper_test.go, msg_server.go, genesis.go, genesis_test.go
  - types/

=== ENVIRONMENT ISSUE ===
The PowerShell execution environment is not functioning correctly.
All shell sessions (tested with go version, pwd, simple echo commands) become invalid
immediately after the wait period expires. This is a systemic issue with the execution
environment, not a problem with the Go code or modules.

To manually verify:
  cd C:\Users\jonathan\AppData\Local\Temp\vibe-kanban\worktrees\ed79-feat-bme-oracle\virtengine
  go build ./x/bme/... ./x/oracle/...
  go test ./x/bme/keeper/... ./x/oracle/keeper/...
