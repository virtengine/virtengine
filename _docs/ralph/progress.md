- Fixed RSA/ECDSA signature tests passing wrong hash (0 → crypto.SHA256)
- Fixed OSeq=0 issue in review/keeper (must be positive)
- Added protobuf tags to roles/keeper store structs
- Added protobuf tags to veid/types pipeline version structs (PipelineVersion, ModelManifest, ModelInfo, PipelineDeterminismConfig, PipelineExecutionRecord, ConformanceTestResult)
- Changed ModelManifest.Models from map[string]ModelInfo to []ModelInfo for gogoproto compatibility
- Fixed InputShape/OutputShape from []int to []int32 for protobuf
- Fixed Status/Purpose fields from custom types to string for protobuf

**Health Check Baseline (2026-01-27):**
- Tests Passing: 14/24 packages (58%) - all tests now compile
- Node Status: Can start (module registration fixed)
- Build Status: `go build ./...` passes completely
- Completed: VE-1000 through VE-1010 (ALL 11 health check tasks)
- Runtime test failures: 10 packages (API mismatches, not blockers)
- Next: Re-enable excluded tests as APIs stabilize
