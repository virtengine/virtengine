# VirtEngine Penetration Testing Scope

## Overview
Penetration test of externally exposed VirtEngine services and critical
operational workflows. The goal is to validate real-world exploitability of
security gaps across the application and infrastructure surface.

## Objectives
- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities and attack paths.
- Validate authentication, authorization, and rate-limiting controls.
- Test resilience against common web and API attack vectors.
- Provide actionable remediation guidance and retest verification.

## In-Scope Targets

### API Surfaces
- Provider daemon APIs (authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints).
- VEID verification APIs and related callbacks.
- Governance/admin endpoints (if externally exposed).

### Network Surfaces
- Public RPC and API gateways.
- Validator and provider public endpoints.
- Monitoring or metrics endpoints exposed externally.

### Authentication and Authorization
- OAuth/OIDC integrations (if enabled).
- API key and token issuance workflows.
- Role-based access control enforcement.

### Data Handling
- Sensitive PII flows (VEID) and encryption boundaries.
- Audit log access paths and export workflows.
- Data retention enforcement and access logging.

## Exclusions
- Social engineering, phishing, or physical access attacks.
- DDoS and load testing (covered separately).
- Third-party SaaS platform internal testing.
- UI-only vulnerabilities without backend impact.

## Rules of Engagement
- Testing windows defined per environment.
- No production testing without explicit approval.
- Use staging/testnet environment for exploitation.
- Provide daily updates and immediate notification for critical findings.

## Required Artifacts
- Asset inventory and endpoint list.
- Test accounts with controlled permissions.
- Sample data sets and test wallets.
- Monitoring access (read-only) for verification.

## Deliverables
- Penetration testing report with severity ratings.
- Exploit narratives with reproduction steps.
- Remediation recommendations and risk assessment.
- Retest verification confirming fixes.

## Timeline
- Estimated duration: 2-3 weeks.
- Draft report by week 2.
- Final report and retest by week 3.
