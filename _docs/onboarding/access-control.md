# Access Control

This document defines access control standards for VirtEngine systems.

## Principles

- Least privilege by default.
- Strong authentication with MFA for privileged access.
- Access granted based on role and approved request.

## Provisioning

- Access requests require manager and system owner approval.
- Accounts are provisioned with role based groups and audited permissions.

## Reviews and Offboarding

- Access reviews occur quarterly for privileged roles.
- Offboarding removes access within one business day.
- Service accounts are tracked and rotated on a defined schedule.

## Evidence

- Access review logs and approvals.
- MFA enforcement configuration exports.
